## Installation and Uninstallation

[Back to top](#)

Installing Elytras of Fire is relatively simple:

1. Download the datapack using the [Releases](https://github.com/iHeronGH/Elytras-of-Fire/releases) tab on the right (this will be populated when the datapack is in a releasable state, which it is not as of writing this.)
2. Open your world folder and place the downloaded folder into the "datapacks" folder. **Make sure you have [Elytras of Fire Lib](https://github.com/iHeronGH/Elytras-of-Fire-Lib) in this same folder, or else this datapack will not work!**
3. Use **`/reload`** in-game to refresh your world. If you have installed it correctly, you will be met with a successful installation message. Thank you for using Elytras of Fire! I hope you enjoy it.

And uninstalling Elytras of Fire is even simpler:

1. Run the command **`/function eof:uninstall`**. This will uninstall Elytras of Fire, completely removing all elements that it uses\* without affecting any other non-dependent DLCs. And that's it!

    *\*Always double-check that this DLC uninstalled correctly! Elytras of Fire does its best to remove itself and its dependencies; if you find that it did not, please [report it as a bug](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfm4wEvcERhBCxIhuzV7Gi4yX_sYCBn8zpUE2acBfyOEFW7OA/viewform?usp=sf_link) on Google Forms or [create an issue](https://github.com/iHeronGH/Elytras-of-Fire/issues) over on Github.*

### IMP Compliance

The following features of Elytras of Fire are listed to prove [IMP compliance](https://github.com/Arcensoth/imp-spec), which are a set of suggested guidelines for Minecraft datapacks that ensure quality, compatibility, and optimal user and development experience.

> Core Standards: [Leave vanilla alone](https://github.com/Arcensoth/imp-spec/blob/master/docs/imp_core.md#1-leave-vanilla-alone)

No changes are made to the **`minecraft`** namespace.

> Core Standards: [Namespace everything](https://github.com/Arcensoth/imp-spec/blob/master/docs/imp_core.md#2-namespace-everything)

All entity tags, custom items, scoreboard objectives, and storages used in Elytras of Fire use the following namespaces to clarify association with Elytras of Fire:

- **`eoflib`**
- **`eof`**

> Documentation: [Function headers](https://github.com/Arcensoth/imp-spec/blob/master/docs/imp_doc.md#function-headers)

All functions utilise the IMP-recommended header to the best of my ability. I do not guarantee 100% accuracy.

> Documentation: [Function annotations](https://github.com/Arcensoth/imp-spec/blob/master/docs/imp_doc.md#function-annotations)

All functions utilise the appropriate IMP-recommended annotations to the best of my ability. I do not guarantee 100% accuracy.
